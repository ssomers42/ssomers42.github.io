			<h2> Overview </h2>
			<p>This was a ten week project with my Global Ties team at UCSD for our non-profit community partner, San Diego Center for Community Health (CCH). My primary role on this project was front-end design and development. I worked with HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JS to make an appealing, mobile friendly web application while also adhering to our client's branding guidelines.
			</p>
			<p><span class="bold">My Role: </span> Team Leader & Front End Design/Development</p> 
			<p><span class="bold">Tools: </span>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, InVision(interactive prototyping), Figma(hi-fi prototypes), Photoshop/Marvel(lo-fi prototypes), pen & paper (paper prototypes). </p>
			<p><span class="bold">The Problem: </span>CCH had just began their Live Well Community Market Program to improve and promote access to healthy food across San Diego county by providing various forms of aid to neighborhood markets. CCH staff began to fill out surveys regarding the current state of markets however they had no way to easily classify the community markets into “levels” which would determine the amount of aid they would provide each market. </p> 
			<p><span class="bold">Our Solution: </span> A web application that serves as an automatic classification tool as well as a visual aid for market information. This solution cuts down the projected time to deal with classifying 70+ markets by hand from a 20+ hour workload to an instant process, effectively saving them both time and money. Because this process significantly reduces the workload, CCH was able to increase the frequency of the market surveys from once every six months to a monthly process, reducing the time it takes for markets to receive their aid and increasing community access to fresh produce.</p>

			<h2> The Process </h2>
			<h4> Understanding the Problem</h4>
			<p>The first step in our process was setting up a meeting with our clients to better understand their problem and discuss what they wanted from our solution. This was crucial to our design process because it gave us valuable insights as to the direction we should be heading. From this meeting we generated a list of 5 needs and 5 insights which allowed us to generate an initial problem statement: </p>
			<ul> <span class="bold bullet"> Needs </span>
				<li>A solution to automate the market assessment and classification process.</li>
				<li>The solution should be able to classify any new survey data that will be collected in the future.</li>
				<li>The interface for the tool should be very simple and intuitive because CCH staff members have intermediate technical fluency.</li>
				<li>The solution needs to be cost-efficient because they do not have enough budget to allocate in this area.</li>
				<li>The automated solution should be easily accessible.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul> <span class="bold bullet"> Insights </span>
				<li>There was currently no one-to-one correspondence between the survey questions they collected data for and the requirements listed for each level.</li>
				<li>Their long-term goal is to make this tool open to market owners so it can motivate them and show them how they can improve their stores.</li>
				<li>They would also in the future like to make this tool available to consumers so they can see what their neighborhood markets and compare markets by their level.</li>
				<li>They would also want to present the progress of the markets that are receiving aids.</li>
				<li>Their plan wanted a solution that is flexible to changes of the market survey questions.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Design Requirements</h4>
			<p>From the information we gathered through research we evaluated many different possible ways to solve this problem. We made the decision to find a solution that would fulfill five design requirements necessary for our client:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Functionality - Multiple concurrent users, quick classification</li>
				<li>Flexibility - Easily changed if the survey were to be altered</li>
				<li>Accessibility - Available to future expansion of user base</li>
				<li>Usability - Simple to use for average to low tech literacy</li>
				<li>Affordability - low to no cost to fit within client’s budget</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After analysis of many possible solutions such as outsourcing work, hiring seasonal intens, and altering the survey for easier classification, we decided automating the process would be the best solution. Other options such as changing up the survey process or hiring interns for manual classification were either not feasible due to constraints or were out of budget for our client. </p>
			<h4> Target Audience Research </h4>
			<p>Our initial findings from <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/16/main-findings-2/"> research </a> were not only that the general population has had a huge increase in cell phone usage over the years (figure 1), but also that 45% of people in the low-income bracket used cell phones as their primary source of internet (figure 2). Our client expressed the desire for this tool to eventually be a resource for not only their staff but also for market owners and eventually the community. Our findings also showed that a large portion of the mobile users in the low-income bracket use android or other third party phones which would not have access to iOS applications.</p>

			</div>
			<h4>Shaping a Solution</h4>
			<p>Rather than designing a mobile app for Android or iOS users, we made the decision to build a responsive web application, as it ultimately meets all five of our design requirements. It is functional in that it allows concurrent users and can do the data processing near instantly, we can make the classification algorithm flexible to allow changes in the survey, widely accessible to those in the low-income bracket, simple ui for ease of use, and the use of a free web hosting platform would make the solution completely free.</p>
			<h4> Rapid Prototyping </h4>
			<p>After our initial ideating and research process we began paper prototyping. From talking more with our clients, they discussed two core functionalities essential to the design: a datatable displaying all of the markets and their information, as well as some sort of way to visualize the data. From this information we came up a with multiple paper prototypes to get our thoughts down on paper. From these initial prototypes we discussed which ideas we were going to keep and came up with two different options, a horizontal view which stacked the market profiles and the vertical view which places the market profile side-by-side with the datatable. After getting our initial ideas down on paper we made rapid low fidelity prototypes using Photoshop and Marvel. We then met with our client to go over what we had created and get their feedback as to which view they preferred and possible changes they would like to make.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h4> Initial Feedback </h4>
			<p>We met with the CCH staff to discuss our current work and gave them interactive low-fidelity prototypes to test. From this testing we looked to gain insight on preferred view(horizontal or vertical), additional desired functionality, their thoughts on the methods of displaying data, and to ensure the prototype was intuitive. Our results were inconclusive on preferred view, so moving forward our next prototypes would include both views. From this testing we generated an additional list of features to be added for our next iteration: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Specific market requirements checklist</li>
				<li>Data table search market by address</li>
				<li>A way to visualize location</li>
				<li>Data table filters</li>
			</ul>
			<h4> High Fidelity Prototyping </h4>
			<p> After meeting with the back-end team and determining the desires would all be feasible, we used our client’s feedback to redesign the user interface. The changes that we made from what we learned at the meeting included: a more in-depth market profile including a checklist detailing the requirements each market has met and still needs to complete, a more visible search bar, a google maps view for the markets including pins color-coordinated to their location, including filters for both the data table as well as the pie chart. </p>

			<h4> User Testing - More Feedback </h4>
			<p>After creating the high-fidelity prototypes using Figma we began a round of user testing. The user testing involved our primary stakeholders, CCH staff, as well as various students around the UCSD campus that would be representative of our client’s student interns. We did our best to choose users that were of similar tech fluency as our client and their staff. From this phase of user-testing we had two main takeaways. </p>
			<ol>
				<li> The filters were unintuitive - our users expected both the data table as well as the pie chart to be affected once the filters were applied.</li>
				<li>The vertical view was preferred - The horizontal view wasted space with the dashboard taking up the majority of the screen when the datatable was almost always the first component the user would look for.</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<h4> Final Design Decisions </h4>
			<p> Once the preferred view had been chosen our team made final design decisions before implementation.In the final product we made the decision to put the search bar and filters on the same line that took up its own row above both the data table and dashboard. This decision both saved space by utilizing one line instead of two, as well as made it more intuitive that the filters would be applied to all elements on the screen. Our team also made the decision to swap the dashboard filters out with an option to toggle the view method instead, for example you can view by levels or by store type. This component was placed within the borders of the dashboard on the right to signify to the user that it would affect only elements within the dashboard. When the view is toggled it affects both the pie chart and the google maps view. </p>
			<h4> Implementation </h4>
			<p>My personal role in the implementation was using HTML and CSS to build the header, about page, contact page, and organize all elements on the home page, use JS to manage the tab creation when a market was clicked, and I was responsible for making the full application mobile-friendly. We re-evaluated our final product to ensure we met the design requirements we initially set. The product is functional, the web application immediately classifies markets and allows for multiple concurrent users. It is flexible, we provided full documentation, including a video tutorial, for how to upload a new survey rubric should they decide to change it.The finished product utilizes the free web-hosting service heroku to maintain affordability. It is mobile-friendly meaning it is accessible should the staff choose to expand their user base to market owners or consumers. Finally the application proved to be usable throughout user-testing including with users of lower-than-average tech literacy. </p>
			<h4> Takeaway </h4>
			<p>Overall, our client was very pleased with our finished product and emphasized the impact the application will have on not only her organization but also in increasing the access to fresh produce in underserved areas of San Diego. As a result of this experience I learned the importance of gaining outside perspective through user-testing. We had many rounds of user-testing and in each I was able to gain more insight as to the way the users expected the product to function. Oftentimes as a designer we project our own framework and expectations onto our work and it can be difficult to think of other possible use cases. This is why I firmly believe in the importance of the human-centered design process.</p>
