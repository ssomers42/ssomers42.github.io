				<h2> Overview </h2>
				<p>This was a ten week design project for my Interaction Design course at UCSD. This responsive web application is used to simplify the group shopping experience for college students with a shareable shopping list. This project includes storyboards, A/B testing
				</p>
				<p><span class="bold">My Role: </span> Full Development </p> 
				<p><span class="bold">Tools: </span>HTML, CSS, JS, Google Analytics (A/B Testing), Marvel(lo-fi prototypes) , pen & paper (paper prototypes/storyboarding). </p>
				<p><span class="bold">The Problem: </span>As a college student I live with multiple roommates and we all share groceries. We use a whiteboard on the fridge to let each other know what we need to buy. On multiple occasions two different roommates would return home after a spontaneous grocery run to find out that another roommate had already made the trip.</p> 
				<p><span class="bold">My Solution: </span> When2Buy is a shopping list application that allows multiple users to collaborate on the same list by generating a shareable url. This list also allows for easy creation through the suggested items section which is populated by recently bought items.</p>

				<h2> The Process </h2>
				<h4> Storyboarding</h4>
				<p>To get an idea of typical use cases for the application I began the design process with storyboarding to get an idea of typical use cases for the product. Three storyboard scenarios were created.</p>
				<ol>
					<li> A user wants notifications when it's time to buy more of an item. </li>
					<li> Roommates want to collaborate on a list and be notified when the list is updated by another user. </li>
					<li> A person planning a party and wants food suggestions from guests so they send out a shareable link </li>
				</ol>

					<p class="caption"> Storyboard Scenario #1 </p>
				</div>
				<h4>Paper Prototypes</h4>
				<p>My next step was paper prototyping. After making a basic sitemap, the initial paper prototypes involved three main user pathways. Creating a list, viewing a list, or sharing a list. In these prototypes each item on a list had its own reminder date as well as the date it was last bought.</p>

				<h4> Digital Mockup & User Feedback </h4>
				<p>After getting the initial application structure down on paper I transferred them onto Balsamiq for easy user testing. For user testing I had each user think aloud as they walked through the task of first creating a list, adding an item to the list, and lastly sharing the list. After testing on various users there were three main takeaways. </p> 
				<ol>
					<li> Users preferred a "due date" on an overall shopping list rather than each individual item.</li>
					<li> The process could be simplified by removing the share screen and adding a share button to each individual list.</li>
					<li> Users wanted a two-step process to removing items from the list. First crossing them out then removing them all at once.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The low-fidelity digital mockup can be seen below reflecting these changes. </p>

				<h4> Analytics of MVP- A/B Testing </h4>
				<p>After receiving feedback on the low-fidelity prototype I began coding the application using HTML, CSS, and JS. I formulated a hypothesis that the current location of the New Item/Share buttons would be better located at the bottom of the screen. My reasoning for this was that although the buttons may be more visible at the top of the screen, on a mobile device they would be more accessible to users when located at the bottom, within the range of the user's thumb. I created two different screen that users would be redirected to randomly and shared my heroku url on social media pages designated for college students to better represent my target demographic. As shown in the figure below, the app received total pageviews with 105 of these being unique users. List A - the view hypothesized to be more efficient with the buttons at the bottom of the screen had a conversion rate of 57.14%. List B - the original view with the buttons at the top had an observed conversion rate of 41.18%.  </p>

				<h4>Finishing Design Choices & Takeaways</h4>
				<p>After moving the buttons to be more accessible at the bottom of the screen I made more minor design fixes. I chose to remove the user icon and move the title on the homescreen further up because it was taking up valuable screen space. I added a themed image to the background and used an off-white color for the buttons to create a crisp, modern feel for the app. </p>

			  <p>This project was a great learning experience that helped my develop skills in A/B testing, user research, and refining my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS. This project is still a work in progress as the data is persistent across all versions. Further work will include implementing a database to create personalized accounts. If I were to do this project again I would take more time to develop a better A/B test and take more time documenting the project. </p>
